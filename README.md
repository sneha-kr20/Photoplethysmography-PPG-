# Arrhythmia Detection and Signal Processing

This project involves processing PPG signals for arrhythmia detection and heart rate variability analysis.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`

## Scripts
- `arrhythmia_detection.py`: Detects arrhythmias in the PPG signal.
- `feature_extraction.py`: Extracts features such as heart rate and respiratory rate.
- `preprocessing.py`: Preprocesses the PPG signal.
- `visualization.py`: Visualizes the PPG signal and saves plots.

## Usage
Run each script with the appropriate data for arrhythmia detection, feature extraction, preprocessing, and visualization.
